# Exoplanets Queries

## Overview
This is a set of SQL queries on an extract from [NASA's exoplanet archive](http://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/).

The dataset provides information about exoplanets - planets that orbit stars different from our sun - as well as the stars they are orbiting.

In this repository you can find the scripts to generate and populate the tables.


## Requirements
* Any relational database management system, like [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).


## Usage
* Access your database system interface/console.
* Import and run the `init.sql` script to create and populate the tables.
* Execute the queries you need.


## Acknowledgments
* This application was developed as an exercise for Coursera's [Data-driven Astronomy](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-driven-astronomy) course.
